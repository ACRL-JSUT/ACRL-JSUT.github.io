<h1>Advanced Control and Robotics Laboratory (ACRL)</h1>
</div>
<p>Advanced Control and Robotics Laboratory (ACRL) is directed by 
Profs. Youwu Du, Bo Li, and Junjie Zhao at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering,
Jiangsu University of Technology, Changzhou 213001, Jiangsu, China.
We focus on control theory and its application, artificial intelligence, and robot control. Current research interests include disturbance estimation and rejection, event-triggered control, active disturbance rejection control, finite-time control, Markov system, and robotic control.</p>
